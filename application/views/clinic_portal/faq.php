					<span>The sickness benefit shall not be paid for more than 240 days on account of the same illness. If the

					<span>Failure to observe the rule on notification shall be a ground for the reduction or denial of the sickness claim application. If the member notifies the SSS beyond the prescribed five-day period, the confinement shall be deemed to have started not earlier than the fifth (5th) day immediately preceding the date of notification.</span><br><br>
					<div style="width: 63%;border: 1px solid;">

					</div>

					<br>

					<span style='font-size:13px; font-weight:bold; '>What if the last day of filing falls on a weekend or a holiday?</span><br>

Once approved by SSS, COMPBEN team reverts to the employee advising the schedule of nearest payout via ATM whichever cut-off period the SSS approval falls in.
